INTRODUCTION                                                         *notgrep*

NotGrep makes it easy to use replacements for grep. This plugin will allow you
to run grep-like programs from vim and show the results in a split window.

:NotGrep[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                       *:NotGrep*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}. Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you. If [!] is not given the first
    error is jumped to.

:NotGrepAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                    *:NotGrepAdd*

    Just like |:NotGrep|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:NotGrepFromSearch [{directory}]                          *:NotGrepFromSearch*

    Just like |:NotGrep| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LNotGrep [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                        *:LNotGrep*

    Just like |:NotGrep| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LNotGrepAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                  *:LNotGrepAdd*

    Just like |:NotGrepAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:NotGrepFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                  *:NotGrepFile*

    This command doesn't work with global indexers like Code Search.

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}. Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence. <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

SEARCH TOOLS                                                   *notgrep-tools*

To use notgrep, you need to setup a search program and a corresponding
errorformat. For example, to use grep with notgrep:
>
        let g:notgrep_prg = "grep -nH"
        let g:notgrep_efm = "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m"
<

NotGrep has commands to setup some search tools.

:NotGrepUseRipgrep

        Setup notgrep to use ripgrep [https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep].

:NotGrepUseAck

        Setup notgrep like the original ack.vim [http://betterthangrep.com/].
        This is the default if no g:notgrep_prg is specified.

:NotGrepUseCsearch

        Setup notgrep to use csearch. [https://code.google.com/p/codesearch/].


==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                                      *notgrep-options*

*g:notgrep_efm*

    The errorformat that interprets the search tool's output. See
    |notgrep-tools|.

*g:notgrep_highlight*

    Whether to guess the search query and highlight that after a notgrep
    search.

*g:notgrep_no_mappings*

    If set, disables quickfix mappings. See |notgrep-mappings|.

*g:notgrep_prg*

    The errorformat that interprets the search tool's output. See
    |notgrep-tools|.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                    *notgrep-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o       open file (same as enter).

go      preview file (open but maintain focus on notgrep.vim results).

t       open in a new tab.

T       open in new tab silently.

v       open in vertical split.

gv      open in vertical split silently.

q       close the quickfix window.
